#A palindrome is a string that is written the same forward as it is in reverse. Write a method to return the longest palindrome in a given string
 
def longest_palindrome(string)
	array = string.split(//)
	palin = []
	temp = []
	array.each do |char|
		string[0]
end
 
longest_palindrome("afbbbfjdjklgdfdhfdkjfffhhfffjkdfhdhkyejejfjkd") #=> "dhfdkjfffhhfffjkdfhd"

# possible tools:

# regex
# string.reverse
# string.split
# map
# each with index?

#if the first char matches
