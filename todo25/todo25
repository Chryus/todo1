Ah-ha! It seems we have a web page with nested h3s, which is a bit no-no in HTML5. The resulting effect is a cascading size increase for each successive header. 

Using the web inspector's hourglass feature, when you hover over a header and compare it with its predescessor, you can see that nesting h3s is causing the browser to nearly double the width and height of each h3.

Given that the DOCTYPE says HTML 3.2, I estimate this page dates back to 1997.
